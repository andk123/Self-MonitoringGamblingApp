# Self-MonitoringGamblingApp
Android application to keep track of gambling activities for excessive players, and reduce the gambling behavior.

There is a big concern among casino games, lottery, excessive gambling, and with the
expansion of online gambling making these activities much more accessible, we can
notice a considerable increase of the gambling activities among young players which in
the end may result in very positive results for the business, but negatively for the
gambler, who may suffer many negative consequences (e.g.,addiction, ruin). The
gambling monitoring project consists of developing a smartphone application targeting
the gambling activities of young players, notably college students, and giving them the
means to control their gambling behavior. Research shows that up to 80% of college
students gamble or already have, and a significant number develop gambling-related
problems. Hence, if a player develops excessive gambling behavior such as playing for
an excessive amount of time or losing an unreasonable amount of money while playing,
the application should identify this pattern and notify the player of his behaviours giving
him some recommendations where applicable.
